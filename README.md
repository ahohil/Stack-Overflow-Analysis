# Stack-Overflow-Analysis

This research project will primarily focus on analyzing if there exists a relationship between the
reported job satisfaction of a software programmer relative to the amount of hours worked in a
week and their reported compensation (standardized to U.S. Dollars).

Our team performed multivariate linear regression to better understand if there was a relationship between a software programmer’s
reported job satisfaction, the hours per week they report working, and the overall compensation
they’ve listed. Cross validation methods were utilized in conjunction with the multivariate regression in an effort to have a more concrete conclusion to our analysis of the models we developed.

We explored a publicly available survey data set from Stack Overflow
focusing on responses from the 2019 and 2020 results.
